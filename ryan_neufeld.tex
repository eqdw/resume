  Spent my summer working with my mentoring organization, the Thousand Parsec Project, as part of the Google Summer of Code program. Participated in a full small-scale project cycle, developing a new ruleset for the self-named game framework. Development took place exclusively in C++, building a version of the board game Risk. The project was finished far ahead of schedule and I continued to create an SVG map importer and a short series of screencasts. Work on the project was done over the internet as my mentors and leaders lived in the USA and Australia.
